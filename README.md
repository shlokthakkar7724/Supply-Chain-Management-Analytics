# Supply-Chain-Management-Analytics
This project builds a dynamic Material Requirements Planning (MRP) dashboard that tracks customer orders, SKU quantities, and manufacturing time for a multi-SKU automotive parts supplier. Visualizations and data modeling are performed using Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Jupyter Notebooks.
